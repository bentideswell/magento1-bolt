- Added improvements to the queueing system for the auto flush cache.

- 24/07/2017 - v2.2.1.0

- Added WordPress plugin to auto refresh cache for blog posts.

- 08/05/2017 - v2.2.0.34

- 13/07/2016 - v2.2.0.25

- 15/06/2016 - v2.2.0.22
- Memcache fix when using unix sockets.

- 14/06/2016 - v2.2.0.21
- Fixed session/hole punch issue. This issue occurs when a Magento site has an early session instantiated (PHPSESSID). The fix allows Bolt and the hole punch to continue working as normal.

- 28/04/2016 - v2.2.0.20
- Fixed issue that broke auto refresh when running Magento in a sub-directory.

- 08/03/2016 - v2.2.0.18
- Fixed issue with compare.

- 01/03/2016 - v2.2.0.17
- Bolt now listens for the no-cache or nocache cookie. If this is set, Bolt is disabled. This can be used by other modules and developers to disable Bolt cache when required.

- 29/02/2016 - v2.2.0.16
- Fixed issue with compare.

- 03/02/2016 - v2.2.0.15

- 01/02/2016 - v2.2.0.14
- Added fix using Redis sessions with a Redis password.
- Added better isDebug checking

- 15/01/2016 - v2.2.0.12
- Small bug fix for identifying when session messages exist.

- 29/10/2015 - v2.2.0.10
- Auto refresh parent products when child product is saved.

- 16/10/2015 - v2.2.0.9
- Added better error checking for Bolt returning control to Magento.

- 15/10/2015 - v2.2.0.8
- Added better checking for session messages. This now checks in the HTML for specific HTML classes and when one is found, the page isn't cached. This will stop users seeing messages meant for other users.

- 26/09/2015 - v2.2.0.6
- Fixed issue when using Memcache with error reporting enabled.

- 25/09/2015 - v2.2.0.5
- Added fix when using file cache on Windows machines. Cache key's with query strings failed due to the '?' parameter. Query strings are now hashed before being used in the cache key. Removed the <!--B--> before the body tag. Bolt now adds a HTTP header when it is active and when hole punching is active.

- 04/09/2015 - v2.2.0.0
- Added licensing to the extension.

- 31/08/2015 - v2.1.1.12
- Fixed issue with isAjax URLs that caused URLs with the isAjax parameter to return the cached page of the same request without the isAjax parameter.

- 20/08/2015 - v2.1.1.11
- Fixed a small bug that caused issues when $_GET parameters where specified inside the URL and not the query string.

- 14/08/2015 - v2.1.1.10
- Improved hole punching so even if hole punching is enabled, it's only done when actually required.

- 13/08/2015 - v2.1.1.9
- Added 'onestepcheckout' to the list of URLs to not cache by default

- 04/08/2015 - v2.1.1.8
- Added small fix for a new issue that broke the hole punch when using HTML minification in Opti. Opti removed some comments that Bolt needed for the hole punch. These comments are still removed but after Bolt has used them.

- 28/07/2015 - v2.1.1.7
- Removed the <!--B--> comment from the HTML when Bolt is enabled. This was causing some minify HTML speed reports to report only a 99% minification score when using Opti. To test whether Bolt is running, add the ___bolt=1 parameter, which will force the inclusion of the <!--B--> (or <!--BH--> if hole punching is active) comment just before </body>

- 27/07/2015 - v2.1.1.6
- Added 'Multiple Themes' option. If set to Yes, different versions of your site will be cached for desktop, mobile and tablets. If you have separate themes for any of these mediums, select Yes for this option. If you have a single theme or a responsive theme, select No. This option defaults to 'Yes'.

- 17/07/2015 - v2.1.1.5
- Moved check for isTablet before isMobile as isMobile returns true for some tablets.

- 13/07/2015 - v2.1.1.4
- Renamed Mobile_Detect class to Fishpig_Bolt_MobileDetect to avoid conflicts with other modules that also use Mobile_Detect but don't do so in a responsible way (ie. include it without checking whether it's already been included).

- 10/07/2015 - v2.1.1.3
- This update fixes the ACL issue present when using Magento 1.9.2.0. If you get an 'Access Denied' message when viewing the SmartTabs admin page (even after logging out and logging back in) and are using Magento 1.9.2.0, upgrading to this version will fix that issue.

- 06/07/2015 - v2.1.1.2
- Updated the way the hole punch handles blocks that contain an empty string. Previously these would not have been hole punched (leaving the incorrect content in place) but now will be hole punched with an empty string.

- 06/07/2015 - v2.1.1.1
- Updated the change log so that the data inside it can be used on http://fishpig.co.uk/magento/extensions/bolt-full-page-cache/#changelog

- 30/06/2015 - v2.1.1.0
- Stopped the 'Bolt is punching holes' message being logged to exception.log. This message was logged each time hole punching occurred and although it could be safely ignored, it quickly filled the log files and took up disk space.

- 10/06/2015 - v2.1.0.5
- Adding  ?___refresh=bolt to the request URL now refreshes the cache entry for the given URL again. This had stopped working sometime previously.

- 29/05/2015 - v2.1.0.1
- Fixed issue that caused items in the cart to sometimes not display. This could happen intermittently but is now fully resolved.

- 07/04/2015 - v2.0.3.4
- Fixed fatal error that's caused when a Magento module uses the 'Mobile_Detect' PHP library file. This error may still occur if the extension that uses it does not check whether a class with the name 'Mobile_Detect' already exists.

- 25/03/2015 - v2.0.3.2
- Fixed the auto cache flushing of products when updating stock records.

- 11/02/2015 - v2.0.2.6
- Updated the code for older version of PHP that do not allow the calling of static methods where the class name is a variable. Bolt is now compatible with these older PHP versions.

- 08/12/2014 - v2.0.1.3
- Fixed an issue that caused heavy slow down when using the Magento API. If mass updating products via the API, the cache records would be automatically cleared after updating each product, causing a massive decrease in response time. Bolt now knows when the request is an API request and temporarily disables the auto refresh features.

- 12/11/2014 - v2.0.0.2
- Added a cache layer to the hole punch system. This makes the hole punch even quicker but can be disabled via the configuration.

- 28/10/2014 - v2.0.0.0
- Added support for Memcache and Redis cache types. To make use of these new cache types, simply configure Magento to use them in the normal way and then flush the Magento cache. Bolt will automatically pickup on your new configuration. Better configuration defaults have also been added so that the extension comes ready to use.
